## Project Overview

The **[ Music Playlist Manager App]** is a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in the [HMAW0501] subject. This application was created using **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**. The app's primary purpose is to [allow users to store the songs of their choice in a personal playlist which can be accessed by them anytime they want to hear to music ].

The app was developed to meet the requirements of the assignment, which includes creating a functional mobile app and utilizing GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.

## Purpose and Features

### Purpose:
The main goal of this app is to [provide users a platform where they can add the songs of their choice to the playlist and listen to it later]. 

### Key Features:
- Feature 1: [The users are able to store as many songs as they want in the playlist as the playlist is not limited to few songs]
- Feature 2: [the app also shows the ratings for the songs with the help of input provided by the users which keeps the highest rated song on the top]
- Feature 3: [the app has a Snackbar function which helps the user to know e.g if there is no input in song title, artist name , rating the app ask the user to put input with the help of snackbar function ]

These features aim to provide [an easy-to-use platform for managing tasks and organizing music(songs) based on users personal choice ].

## Design Considerations

The design of the **[ Music Playlist Manager App ]** was based on the following key considerations:

1. **User Experience (UX)**: The app was designed with the goal of providing an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.
   
2. **Responsiveness**: The app was built to ensure it performs well on different screen sizes, with particular attention to device compatibility.
   
3. **Simplicity**: The design is minimalistic, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.
   
4. **Performance**: Code optimization was considered to ensure fast response times and low battery usage.

## GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

### GitHub Actions:
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated **tests** to ensure the appâ€™s functionality.
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.

## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: [the challenge i faced was initiating all the function and clearing the error as my error was not visible on the android studio but it was an internal error ]
   - **Solution**: [after a lot research and trial and error i was able to understant that there was a problem in string therefore i corrected it and then the app started working"]
   
2. **Challenge 2**: [the another problem i faced was Debugging issues related to Gradle builds as it was giving me error of .kt not part of app."]
   - **Solution**: [after researching on internet i was able to understand what can be the problem and then i check so i found my class input of app was wrong while fixing other issues it happend then i fixed it and then the app start to work properly without any errors]

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions.

## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:

1. **Feature 1**: [i would like to add a multipal playlist option so the user will be able to save music in diffrent playlists according to the requirments"]
2. **Feature 2**: [i will add a suggestion box s the app will collect data from users current playlist and provide new songs suggestion similler to the songs in users playlist.]
3. **Feature 3**: [i would add a dark mode and a notification option so whenever a new song of users favourate artist is realised it will notifiy the user.]
